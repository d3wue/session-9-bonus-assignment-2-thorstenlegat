# Bonus Assignment 2: Webscraping

In your second project, you will write a tool to extract and collect soccer data from [transfermark.com](https://www.transfermarkt.com/). This website provides data on soccer teams, and especially soccer players, from all relevant leagues around the globe.

For this assignment, you should focus on extracting the available information for one league.

Your program should have at least a minimal interface to interact with the data. You could for example use the following options (depending on the focus of your program):
  1. Show available teams
  2. Select team and show high level information on the team
  3. Select team and and show all players of the team
  4. Stop the program
